<h1>Croissant🥐</h1>   
<div class="about-croissant">
Golden, flaky, and irresistibly buttery — croissants are the kind of pastry that make mornings feel indulgent.
 With each delicate layer, they whisper of Parisian cafés, slow sips of coffee, and the simple joy of tearing into something freshly baked.
Crisp on the outside yet soft and airy inside, a croissant is more than just breakfast — it’s an experience, a little moment of luxury wrapped in pastry. Whether you enjoy it plain, filled with rich chocolate,
 or paired with a touch of jam, a croissant has a way of turning the ordinary into something extraordinary.
